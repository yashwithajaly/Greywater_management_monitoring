üîç About the Project
A greywater monitoring and management system that filters wastewater using natural filters and monitors water quality using sensors connected to an ESP board. The data is sent to ThingSpeak and displayed in a Flutter mobile app.

üîå Hardware Requirements
ESP32 / ESP8266 board

USB cable for ESP

pH Sensor

Turbidity Sensor

Water level sensor

Filtration setup (cotton, charcoal, etc.)

Jumper wires

Breadboard (optional)

üíª Software Requirements
Arduino IDE (latest version)

Internet connection (for ThingSpeak)

Flutter SDK & VS Code (for the app)

üîß Wiring & Setup
Explain how the sensors are connected:

pH sensor ‚Üí GPIO X

Turbidity sensor ‚Üí GPIO Y

Water level sensor ‚Üí GPIO Z
(Include a simple diagram or image if possible)

‚öôÔ∏è ESP & Arduino Configuration
Connect the ESP board to your laptop via USB.

Open Arduino IDE.

Go to Tools > Board and select ESP32 Dev Module (or your board).

Go to Tools > Port and select the appropriate COM port.

Paste and upload the code to the board.

üì° ThingSpeak Setup
Create a free ThingSpeak account.

Create a new channel and note the Channel ID and Read API Key.

Add fields for pH, turbidity, water level, etc.

Add these values to your code.

üì± Flutter App
The Flutter app connects to ThingSpeak using the Channel ID and API key, and displays:

Live pH values

Turbidity levels

Water level

Graphs and alerts
